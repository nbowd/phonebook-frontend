Frontend for a phonebook CRUD application built with React.js, Axios, and Express while following a RESTful architecture. 

Uses React conventions to create a dynamically updated page, allowing users to add contacts to their phonebook by storing their name and number. If a user enters a duplicate name, they are given an option to update their stored number for the updated one. Contains a search feature that updates the results in real time.

The backend portion of this app creates a build from the frontend and serves it on the Heroku app. This functions as the development environment.
